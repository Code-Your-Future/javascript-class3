# JS III Homework Assignment

1. Make a game!
	* Build a game using HTML/CSS with JavaScript for DOM Manipulation and Event Handling. We suggest Noughts and Crosses / Tic Tac Toe, but other options could be the memory game or the bowling score card. The rules are...
		- The game should have user interaction
		- Have at least 3 different functions
		- Have at least one callback function
		- Use objects (this can also be a source of inspiration for what kind of game to make)
		- The game has to run on an HTML page (live on Github)
		- All the code needs to be commented
		- The github page should have a readme describing how the game/code works and a whishlist of features to be added in the future
		- The JS code should follow the airbnb style guide: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5
	* We learned about how to create, assign values to, and iterate over Arrays and Objects - this might be useful.
		- refer to the class materials for starters.
	* Try not to use `document.write` anymore - instead try `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll` to select DOM elements and manipulate them with JS.
		- this is a nice summary of useful DOM manipulation methods: http://callmenick.com/post/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation.
	* we didn't cover event listeners, so you will need to research the `.addEventListener` method on your own this week in order to handle a user's interaction with your game.
		- In your browser, try running the event listener materials from the class https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/javascript-class3/blob/master/materials/4-dom-events.md
		- MDN documentation for `.addEventListener`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
